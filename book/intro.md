# Developing Agentic AI with Opik

## Introduction

Unsurprisingly, this book is about three things:

1. Development
2. Agentic AI
3. Opik

### What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI represents a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, moving beyond simple prompt-response interactions to systems that can autonomously reason, plan, and execute complex tasks. Unlike traditional AI models that respond to individual queries, agentic systems maintain context, make decisions, and use tools to accomplish multi-step objectives.

An agentic AI system is characterized by its ability to:

- **Reason** about problems and break them down into manageable steps
- **Plan** sequences of actions to achieve goals
- **Execute** actions using available tools and resources
- **Observe** the results of its actions and adapt accordingly
- **Iterate** until the objective is met or a stopping condition is reached

### Why Opik?

Opik is a powerful framework designed specifically for developing, monitoring, and improving agentic AI systems. Built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP), Opik provides the infrastructure needed to:

- **Track** every interaction, decision, and outcome in your agentic systems
- **Debug** complex agent behaviors through detailed traces and spans
- **Evaluate** agent performance across different scenarios and datasets
- **Optimize** prompts, tools, and system configurations based on real-world usage
- **Experiment** with different approaches and compare results systematically

### Who This Book Is For

This book is designed for developers, researchers, and practitioners who want to:

- Build production-ready agentic AI systems
- Understand the core concepts and architecture of agentic systems
- Learn how to use Opik for development, monitoring, and optimization
- Implement best practices for agentic AI development
- Debug and improve existing agentic systems

### What You'll Learn

In this book, we'll cover:

**Chapter 1: Core Concepts** - We'll explore the fundamental building blocks of agentic AI systems, including LLMs, traces, spans, threads, tools, metrics, datasets, experiments, and the various types of prompts that guide agent behavior.

**Chapter 2: Agentic Systems** - We'll dive into building complete agentic systems from scratch, learning how to combine the core concepts into working solutions that can tackle real-world problems.

**Reference** - Practical guides for self-hosting Opik and running online evaluations.

### Getting Started

To follow along with the examples in this book, you'll need:

```bash
pip install opik ez-mcp-toolbox
```

Throughout this book, we'll use practical examples and code snippets to illustrate concepts. Each chapter builds upon the previous one, so we recommend reading sequentially if you're new to agentic AI development.

Let's begin our journey into developing agentic AI systems with Opik!
